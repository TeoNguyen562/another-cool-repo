# My Thoughts

No Thoughts. Head Empty. I've been just studying throw exceptions and raw pointers and vectors again because honestly I still don't understand this. Also GO BIRDS!

Damn

I should probably go to office hours for once.

# Academic Honesty

I promise not to forget that all future assignments may be heavily penalized for failure to commit frequently as I do my work.
